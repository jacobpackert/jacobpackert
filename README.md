## Hi, I'm Jacob ðŸ‘‹

I like the Internet, tech, music and code.

I live in lovely [Copenhagen](https://jacobpackert.dk/blog/why-bicycling-in-copenhagen-is-so-fantastic/).

I work as a Senior Engineer at [LEGO](https://lego.com), building fun stuff for grown-ups.

I used to work with politics, then I worked with marketing. Some would say thatâ€™s the same thing.

Now I write code for a living and build products and websites. For work and for fun.

I love Typescript and React and Iâ€™m building a few apps with React Native and Expo. Occassionaly trying out new adventures in languages like Python, Swift and Rust.
