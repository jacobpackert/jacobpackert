## Hi, I'm Jacob 👋

I like the Internet, tech, music and code.

I live in lovely [Copenhagen](https://jacobpackert.dk/blog/why-bicycling-in-copenhagen-is-so-fantastic/).

I work as a Frontend Engineer at [DR](https://dr.dk), the Danish Broadcasting Corporation.

I used to work with politics, then I worked with marketing. Some would say that’s the same thing.

Now I write code for a living and build products and websites. For work and for fun.

I love Javascript and React ⚛️ and I’m building a few apps with React Native and Expo 📱 For data science and Raspberry Pi fun I'm learning Python 🐍.
